# Ayra

A dungeon exploration style shooter where your objective is to locate all the enemies and defeat them, so that the player is provided with a portal that gives him access to the next stages.

# Mechanics

    - Max HP level up on every level.
    - Enemies with individual lives and attack forms.
    - Remaining enemies counter where the next level will release you.
    - Minimap with the intention of locating, not necessarily showing where the player is.

# Pathc Notes

    - Fixed reverse staff rotation on mobile
    - Fixed player collisions where shots that missed the player accounted for damage
    - Fixed weird slime teleports
    - Fixed collision bugs with between enemies
